# FullCycle 2.0 - Continuous Integration - Challenge

In this challenge, we will consolidate our knowledge in relation to the creation of a CI pipeline by doing the following steps.

- Create a small simple application in node.js (any application at all)
- Create unit tests for that application
- Create a CI pipeline using Github actions that:
  - Install the app
  - Run the tests
  - Run SonarCloud
- Upload this application to a public repository on GitHub and activate the `status check` so that it is possible to merge it only if the application passes through the CI pipeline and also if the application passes through the SonarCloud quality gate.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) performing the entire process.
